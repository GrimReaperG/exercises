## Responsive mockup exercise

Copyright 2015, Fauna, Inc. All rights reserved. For general instructions, see [here](https://github.com/faunadb/exercises/blob/master/README.md).

Your goal is to redesign this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squall

You should create two mockups for the web: one desktop, one mobile (assume a responsive design and implementation). You should also include a two-paragraph written discussion of the user experience of the page and the design decisions you made in light of the user's needs.

General requirements:

  - Use all of the content that you see on the page down to 900px height (your own design can be a different height, though).
  - Use a consistent palette and font set.
  - Please include two examples of hover links.
  - Please use the images included. They may be any size.
  - Include some icons with a consistent visual language.
  - Include a call-to-action button.

Additional notes:

  - The desktop layout should be 950px wide.
  - For mobile, you can show just 1/3 of the body content.
  - You can change the Wikipedia logo if you wish, but you don't have to.
  - If you obscure any items in dropdowns, accordions, or the like, show an example of the expanded view as well.

### Extra credit

  - Choose something in your design that might be difficult for an older browser such as Internet Explorer to render. Include an alternate version of that element for designed older browsers.
