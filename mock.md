## Mock

Copyright 2015, Fauna, Inc. All rights reserved. For general instructions, see [here](https://github.com/faunadb/exercises/blob/master/README.md).

Your task is to create two mockups for the web. One is desktop, one is mobile (responsive design and implementation).
You must also include a two paragraph written portion, discussing the UX of the page and your design decisions given the user's needs.

You have to redesign this page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squall

Requirements, both desktop and mobile:

  - You have to use all of the content that you see on the page down to 900px height. (Though your own design can be a different height)
  - You can obscure items in dropdowns, accordions and the like, but if you do, you must show an example of the expanded view as well.
  - Must use the palette provided below.
  - Must use Raleway for headers and Open Sans for body text.
  - Must use icons somewhere on the page, of the same design language and weight as one another.
  - You can change the wikipedia logo if you wish. You don't have to.
  - Must follow the grid used here: https://faunadb.com/styleguide#grid.
  - Must include two examples of hover links.
  - Use the images included but they can be used at any size.
  - Must include at least one call to action button somewhere.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faunadb/exercises/master/palette.jpg" width="80%">

Requirements, desktop:

  - Must be 950px in width.

Requirements, mobile:

  - You can show just 1/3 of the body content.
  - If you have a collapsible navigation you must have a seperate mockup to show it open as well.

### Extra credit

 * Find something on the page that you think would be difficult for an older browser to render and show an alternative for older IE.
