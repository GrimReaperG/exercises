## Responsive Mockup

Copyright 2015, Fauna, Inc. All rights reserved. For general instructions, see [here](https://github.com/faunadb/exercises/blob/master/README.md).

Your task is to redesign this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squall

You should create two mockups for the web: one desktop, one mobile (assume a responsive design and implementation). You should also include a two-paragraph written discussion of the user experience of the page and the design decisions you made in light of the user's needs.

General requirements:

  - Use all of the content that you see on the page down to 900px height (your own design can be a different height, though).
  - If you obscure any items in dropdowns, accordions, or the like, show an example of the expanded view as well.
  - Use Raleway for headers and Open Sans for body text.
  - Use icons somewhere on the page. They should share the same design language and weight.
  - You can change the Wikipedia logo if you wish, but you don't have to.
  - Please follow the grid shown here: https://faunadb.com/styleguide#grid.
  - Please include two examples of hover links.
  - Please use the images included. They may be any size.
  - Include at least one call-to-action button.
  - Use the palette provided below.

Desktop-specific requirements:

  - Must be 950px in width.

Mobile-specific requirements:

  - You can show just 1/3 of the body content.
  - If you have a collapsible navigation, include an additional mockup showing it open.
