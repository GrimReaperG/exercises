## Instructions

The instructions are as follows:

- You can work on your own and take as much time as you like.
- You can use existing resources such as Stack Overflow or books. If you get help from another person, please let us know.

Please submit your solution with the job application upload form or as an attachment via email. Do not put your solution on GitHub. If you choose to include a README explaining your approach, we will take that into account as well. We will discuss with you if we have questions.
