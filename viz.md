Consider the following incomprehensible chart:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faunadb/exercises/master/viz/viz.jpg" width="66%">

Your goal is to present this data in a way that makes sense. Your visualization should implemented as a single webpage with valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The original data sources are [here](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/us-food-imports.aspx).

Requirements:

  - You should use a visualization framework such as D3 that interprets an embedded dataset.
  - The visualization should be interactive.
  - The layout should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile.
  - Please include at least two animation effects.
  - Include automated tests for layout or behavior using a framework such as PhantomJS or Galen.
  - Do not use Bootstrap.

Additional notes:

  - You don't need to maintain any of the original graphics unless you want to.

### Extra credit

  - Support simultaneous drilldown by country of origin and food category.
