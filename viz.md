Consider the following incomprehensible chart:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faunadb/exercises/master/viz.jpg" width="50%">

Your task is to reinterpret this data in a way that makes sense. Your visualization should implemented as a single webpage with valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Requirements:

  - You should use a visualization framework like D3 that interprets an embedded dataset.
  - The visualization should be interactive.
  - The layout should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile.
  - Please include at least two animation effects.
  - Do not use Bootstrap.

Additional notes:

  - You can include additional data from other sources to make the visualization more comprehensive. If you do, please document your sources.

### Extra credit

 * Include automated tests for layout and/or behavior with a framework such as Selenium
